# jUnit Un-XCoder - NameFixer

*Problem description*
The jUnit XML files we get from the iOS chapter have a variation that does that we cant compare them to the other names. 
We need to revert to the original name, when we receive the files, so that we can match them. 

Following this we need to know what folder the scenario files are located in. 

## Task Description

Make the test pass.
Only write enough code so that the test passes.
Refactor. 
- Rinse and repeat until you are happy with the logic

## Coding Guidelines

1) Make the test cases pass without changing them
2) Consider adding test cases if you add additional functions
3) Don't write more code than needed - do not invent scenarios
